# Calkulate v2

[![pypi badge](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/calkulate.svg?style=popout)](https://pypi.org/project/calkulate/)

Calkulate calculates alkalinity from potentiometric titration data.

For v1.0.2 (for MATLAB, and only implementing the half-Gran solver) [see the relevant branch](https://github.com/mvdh7/calkulate/tree/1.0.2).

Documentation is under construction at [calkulate.readthedocs.io](https://calkulate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Installation

```python
pip install calkulate
```
